# Assembler

This repository contains an assembler program implemented in Python. The program takes an input file, `input.txt`, processes the assembly code, and generates a binary output file called `output`. The `assembler.py` file is responsible for performing the assembly instructions and generating the corresponding machine code.

## Requirements

To run the assembler program, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Place your assembly code in the `input.txt` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the repository is located.
5. Run the following command to execute the assembler:
    python3 assembler.py
6. The assembler will process the input file and generate the `output` file containing the machine code.
