# Assembler

This repository contains the assembler program with evaluation program implemented in Python. The assembler program is situated in Simple-Assembler directory.
The program takes input from the evaluation program, processes the assembly code, and generates a binary output. The `assembler.py` file is responsible for performing the assembly instructions and generating the corresponding machine code.
The automated Testing directory is responsible for the evaluation.
The Simulator part has not been implemented yet.

## Requirements

To run the assembler program, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python3

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory automatedTesting.
4. Run the following command to execute the assembler:
    ./run --no-sim
5. The program will process the inputs and generate the marks report based on the machine code generated by assembler.py.
