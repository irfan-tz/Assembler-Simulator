# Assembler & Simulator

This repository contains the assembler and simulator program with evaluation program implemented in Python. The assembler program is situated in Simple-Assembler directory.
The program takes input from the evaluation program, processes the assembly code, and generates a binary output. The `assembler.py` file is responsible for performing the assembly instructions and generating the corresponding machine code.
The simulator program is situated in SimpleSimulator directory which also takes test inputs from automatedTesting program and then processes the instruction and generates the data stored in registries as well as the memory. The `simulator.py` file is responsible for processing instructions and showing data stored in registries and memory.
The automated Testing directory is responsible for the evaluation.

## Requirements

To run the assembler program, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python3
- python module named 'bitstring'

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory automatedTesting.
4. Run the following command to execute the assembler:
    ./run 
5. The program will process the inputs and generate the marks report based on the machine code generated by assembler.py and simulator.py from Simple-Assembler and SimpleSimulator directory respectively.
